# SENG265

This repository contains all the assignments from my Software Development Methods course at the University of Victoria. I took this course in the spring of 2023, and these assignments are some of my first times working with medium-sized programs

# A1

This assignment is in C and takes a .csv file of a number of different flight routes. Based on the given input from the command line, flights with specified keywords are found. I created a loop that reads through the .csv file one line at a time, searching for the desired keywords. The desired flights are outputted in a .txt file

# A2

This assignment is in Python and had us take a .yaml of flight routes. Similar to assignment 1, command line inputs determine which flights are searched. By using the **Pandas** library, the contents of the .yaml file were converted into a data frame. **Pandas** helped sift out the unwanted flight, and the wanted ones were again outputted into a .txt file

# A3

This assignment is in C, with the flight routes stored in a .yaml file. The content of each flight route is stored in a node, with all the flights forming a singly linked list. The wanted flights are determined when compiled (once again a command line input) are printed to the console. 

# A4

This assignment is in Python. It creates a .html page that has an image containing many different shapes. The image is randomly created each time the page is created. Randomized numbers are used to determined a shape's size, colour, and shape (whether it is a circle or square). The html page is stored as a .html file.
