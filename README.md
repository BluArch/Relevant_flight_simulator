This assignment was made for the SENG265 course at the University of Victoria. It is written in C and takes a .csv file of a number of different flight routes. Based on the given input from the command line, flights with specified keywords are found. I created a loop that reads through the .csv file one line at a time, searching for the desired keywords. The desired flights are outputted in a .txt file
